## Create and set up database using Postgres

1. install psql -- PostgreSQL interactive terminal <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>

2. open terminal and run `pg_ctl start`

3. run `psql` to run psql shell

4. create user `CREATE USER [your-username] WITH option [option-you-want];` -- make sure to use an option that allows to create a database
   (for more info see the docs <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html>)

5. create database `CREATE DATABASE where_to_eat_db WITH OWNER [your-username];`  
   (for more info see the docs <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html>)

6. move to where_to_eat_db database `\c where_to_eat_db`

7. create tables  
   `CREATE TABLE users (  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,  user_name TEXT NOT NULL,  user_password TEXT NOT NULL);`  
   `CREATE TABLE business (  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,  business_id TEXT NOT NULL);`  
   `CREATE TABLE user_businesses (  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL,  business_id INTEGER REFERENCES business(id) NOT NULL,  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, business_id));`

8. OPTIONAL: seed the table `users` with demo credentials  

   `INSERT INTO users (user_name, user_password)`  
       `VALUES`  
           `('demo_user', '$2a$04$HNAwLgr8vBhbKfbHUKRane/eBWJ5WLzT12WmANApEAex7W.d91jhG');`  
   Note: the password for demo_user is already hashed, you can login with user name `demo_user` and password `demo_password`
